# tools

some useful tools that are written when I am in trouble 

## dir.py
caculates the real size of a directory

## meminfo.py
record meminfo every 5 seconds, output is written in "meminfo.log"

## ape2wav.sh
convert all ape files in current directory to wav

## find_physics.py
I have to find a "Physics for University B" lesson, while I don't want to click the links one by one, so I wrote the script to do it.
